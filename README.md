# Christopher-Hernandez

I'm a cybersecurity student passionate about understanding how systems breakâ€”and how to make them unbreakable. My work focuses on network defense, ethical hacking, and automation for security operations. I enjoy experimenting with tools like Wireshark, Nmap, and Metasploit. My goal is to contribute to a safer digital world by continuously learning, researching, and developing creative security solutions.
